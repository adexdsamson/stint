# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-27)

**Core value:** A prompt-injected or misbehaving agent can never act outside the lease the user granted, and when the lease ends, for any reason, every credential is revoked and the teardown is honestly receipted.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Foundation & ALP Spec

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Lease State Machine & Policy Engine
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-27 — Phase 01 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7 phases in the user-approved build order: spec, then pure core, receipts and licensing, proxy, teardown, CLI, and finally e2e + README. This is one phase above the standard 4-6 band, by user approval.
- [Roadmap]: HostAdapter (HOST-01) and the LeaseStore contract (with an in-memory double and contract suite) are defined in Phase 2 core, because the proxy and teardown depend on them. Reference implementations (HOST-02, HOST-03) land in Phase 6.
- [Roadmap]: Pure logic (policy function PRXY-02/03, error threshold LIFE-07, receipt chains, license refresh bound) is built in Phases 2-3 before any I/O. The proxy (Phase 4) wires it to live calls.
- [Roadmap]: Outcome verification (LIFE-06) and publisher revocation (LIC-04) sit with teardown in Phase 5 ("every way a lease ends").

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Research spike needed on the paseto@4.0.1 factory-composition API, implicit assertions and clock skew.
- [Phase 4]: Research spike needed on oauth4webapi RFC 7009/8707 against oauth2-mock-server. Pin the MCP Authorization spec text first.
- [Phase 6]: Windows atomicity (EPERM/EBUSY on rename) for the JSON LeaseStore. Must be proven on Windows CI.
- [Phase 1 -> 3]: The canonical serializer introduced for the manifest hash (SPEC-06) must be the same one used by receipt chains (RCPT-02).
